## String Art Generation

This project creates string art using Python as main language. It leverages **Pillow**, **Imageio**, **Numpy**
to generate and animate circular string patterns, exporting the final result as a sequence of rendered frames with format GIF.

## Description

String Art Generation is a demonstration of algorithmic art generation, where lines connect points around a circle to form evolving predictable patterns. It's a clear example of how code can be transformed into visual creativity.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Numpy** - numerical array processing.
- **Pillow (PIL)** - for image processing.
- **Imageio** - for compiling frames into animated GIFs.
